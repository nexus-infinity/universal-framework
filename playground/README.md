# Playground

This directory is designated for experimental components and feature prototypes. It's a space for innovation and testing without impacting the core framework structure.

## Structure

- `experimental-components/`: For testing new component ideas
- `feature-prototypes/`: For developing and testing new feature concepts

## Usage

Developers are encouraged to use this area freely for experimentation and innovation. When a component or feature is ready for integration into the main framework, it should be moved to the appropriate module or shared component directory.

## Guidelines

1. Keep experiments isolated from production code
2. Document your experiments
3. Clean up unused experiments regularly
4. When moving to production, ensure proper testing and documentation
