## Directory Purposes

- `ai/`: Contains AI-related code, models, and utilities.
- `backend/`: Houses the backend server code, API routes, and database models.
- `docs/`: Stores documentation for different parts of the project.
- `frontend/`: Contains the frontend application code, components, and assets.
- `infrastructure/`: Includes configuration files for Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.
- `scripts/`: Stores utility scripts for various tasks.
- `shared/`: Contains shared code, types, and utilities used across different parts of the project.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Maintain Structure**: The current project structure MUST BE MAINTAINED. Do not alter the top-level directory structure without team consensus.

2. **Module Development**: When developing new features, place them in the appropriate directory based on their functionality (ai, backend, frontend, etc.).

3. **Documentation**: Update the relevant documentation in the `docs/` directory when adding new features or making significant changes.

4. **Shared Code**: Place any code, types, or utilities that are used across different parts of the project in the `shared/` directory.

5. **Testing**: Write unit tests for your code and place them in the appropriate `tests/` directory within each module.

6. **Infrastructure**: Use the files in the `infrastructure/` directory for deployment and scaling configurations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Jeremy-Rich/universal-framework.git
   cd universal-framework
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Set up the AI environment:
   ```
   cd ai
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Refer to specific README files in each directory for more detailed setup instructions.

## Playground

The `playground/` directory is designated for experimental components and feature prototypes. Feel free to use this area for innovation and testing without impacting the core framework structure.

- `experimental-components/`: For testing new component ideas
- `feature-prototypes/`: For developing and testing new feature concepts

When a component or feature is ready for integration into the main framework, move it to the appropriate module or shared component directory.


## Contributing

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
2. Make your changes, ensuring they adhere to the project structure and guidelines.
3. Write or update tests as necessary.
4. Update documentation if you're introducing new features or changing existing functionality.
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

## GitHub Setup and AI-Enhanced Development

This project leverages cutting-edge AI tools and GitHub features to maintain a world-class development environment. Here's how we set it up:

### GitHub Configuration

1. **Branch Protection Rules**: 
   - Go to Settings > Branches
   - Add rule for `main` and `develop` branches
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging

2. **Issue Templates**:
   - Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory
   - Add templates for bug reports, feature requests, and general issues

3. **Pull Request Template**:
   - Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`
   - Include sections for description, related issues, and checklist

4. **GitHub Actions**:
   - Utilize `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for Continuous Integration
   - Add additional workflows for deployment, dependency updates, etc.

### AI-Enhanced Development

1. **GitHub Copilot**:
   - Enable GitHub Copilot in your development environment
   - Use Copilot for code suggestions, documentation, and test generation
   - Create custom Copilot snippets for project-specific patterns

2. **AI-Powered Code Review**:
   - Integrate AI code review tools (e.g., DeepCode, Amazon CodeGuru)
   - Use AI suggestions to improve code quality and catch potential issues

3. **Automated Documentation**:
   - Use AI tools to generate and maintain API documentation
   - Implement automated README updates based on code changes

### Local Environment Synchronization

1. **Git Hooks**:
   - Use pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting
   - Implement post-merge hooks to update dependencies

2. **Development Containers**:
   - Use Visual Studio Code's Dev Containers or GitHub Codespaces
   - Ensure consistent development environments across the team

3. **Environment Management**:
   - Use `dotenv` for managing environment variables
   - Implement a script to sync environment variables with CI/CD systems

## Project Management Policies

1. **Branching Strategy**:
   - Use GitFlow workflow
   - Feature branches should be created from `develop`
   - Use `release/` branches for preparing releases
   - Hotfixes should be branched from `main`

2. **Code Review Process**:
   - All changes must be reviewed by at least one other developer
   - Use GitHub's pull request review features
   - Leverage AI-powered code review tools for initial feedback

3. **Version Control**:
   - Use Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for release naming
   - Maintain a detailed CHANGELOG.md

4. **Documentation**:
   - Keep README.md up-to-date with project changes
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation in the `docs/` directory
   - Use automated tools to ensure documentation accuracy

5. **Testing**:
   - Maintain high test coverage (aim for >80%)
   - Run tests automatically on each pull request
   - Perform regular performance and security testing

6. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly update dependencies using Dependabot
   - Review and test all dependency updates before merging

7. **Security**:
   - Use GitHub's security features (dependency scanning, secret scanning)
   - Regularly perform security audits
   - Implement and maintain a responsible disclosure policy

8. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Hold regular retrospectives to review and improve processes
   - Stay updated with the latest GitHub features and AI development tools
   - Encourage team members to share knowledge and best practices

By following these policies and leveraging AI-enhanced tools, we maintain a cutting-edge, efficient, and collaborative development environment. Always refer to these guidelines when contributing to the project.
