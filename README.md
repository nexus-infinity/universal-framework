[![CI](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/your-username/your-repo/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/your-username/your-repo?branch=main)

## Getting Started

[Your existing intro and setup details go here]

## Testing

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing.

### Running Tests

To run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

To run tests in watch mode:

```shellscript
npm run test:watch
```

To generate a coverage report:

```shellscript
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Test files are located in the `tests/` directory.
- Name test files using the `.test.js` extension.
- Follow our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for writing tests.


## Continuous Integration (CI)

- CI is configured to run tests automatically on each push or pull request.
- Check the status of CI builds using the badges at the top of this README.


### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js 18.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18.x
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

## Directory Structure

Organize your tests to mirror your source code:

```plaintext
/src
  /components
    Button.js
  /utils
    calculateSum.js
/tests
  /components
    Button.test.js
  /utils
    calculateSum.test.js
```

## Code Quality Tools

### Linting

We use ESLint for linting the codebase. Ensure your code follows our linting rules before submitting changes.

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are set up using Husky. Run the following commands to install hooks:

```shellscript
npx husky install
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm test"
```

## Code Coverage

Configure Jest for code coverage:

```javascript
// jest.config.js
collectCoverage: true,
collectCoverageFrom: ['src/**/*.{js,jsx}'],
coverageDirectory: 'coverage',
```

Use services like Codecov or Coveralls to upload coverage reports in your CI pipeline.

## Development Documentation

Check the development and testing strategy documents inside the `/docs` folder for more detailed information.
